## How To Play

Oh no! The fridge is in disarray. To solve this challenge we will need to create a list and sort our food items into their correct categories.

Where shall we start?

### Step 1

We have taken the food out of the fridge and created the following list:

- Lamb
- Tomatoes
- Chicken
- Cheese
- Broccoli
- Milk

We can now sort these into the following categories:

- Meat
- Dairy
- fruitAndVeg

If you head over to main.js you will see two empty variables that need completing with the above information.

### Step 2

Now we need to put our food items into the correct categories. The empty function on main.js may help you do this.

console.log your foodCategories variable to confirm all items are in the correct place.

Once you have completed your function, add the following error message to indicate if/when an incorrect item has been added:

"You have added an item into the wrong category"

### Step 3

If you think you have a solution, open main.test.js to validate your code. If your tests pass, you have successfully completed this challenge.

### Well done!

If you have made it this far I will assume you have completed the challenge and are ready to move on to Speccy_Squad Irene's repo for challenge 2.
