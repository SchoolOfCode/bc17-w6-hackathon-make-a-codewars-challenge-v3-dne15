## How To Play

Oh no! The fridge is in disarray. To solve this challenge we will need to create a list and sort our food items into their correct categories.

Where shall we start?

### Step 1

We have taken the food out of the fridge and have created the following list:

- Chicken
- Milk
- Tomatoes
- Cheese
- Lamb
- Broccoli

I think we can easily sort these into the following categories:

- Meat
- Dairy
- Veg

If you head over to main.js you will see two empty variables that need completing with the above information.

### Step 2

Now we just need to figure out how to put our food items into our categories ðŸ¤” The empty function on main.js may help you do this.

console.log your foodCategories variable to confirm all items are in the correct categories.

### Step 3

If you think you have a solution, open main.test.js to validate your code. If your tests pass, you've successfully completed this challenge.

Except test 5, I couldn't get this to work ðŸ˜…

### Well done!

If you have made it this far I will assume you have completed the challenge and are ready to move on to Speccy_Squad Irene's repo for challenge 2.
